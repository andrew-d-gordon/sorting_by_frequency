  "description": "Web App to process text and output a list ordered primarily by frequency of the words, and secondarily by lexicographic order when frequency is tied. As a constraint, this app attempts to avoid built-in sorting utils. A custom implementation of [Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) and [Bisect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection_(software_engineering)) algorithms are used in tandem with a word dictionary/hash map to maintain the sorted order of the output list as new items are added.",
